# Create a function that finds the maximum number out of three values
# We can create a first function to find the max number out of two values

# We define a function with "def" + the name of the function + (what goes in the parentheses are the input values)
def max_of_2(x, y):
    if x > y: # We start by asking if the first value "x" is greater than the value "y"
        return x # If so, we return the value "x" out of the function
    return y # Else, we return the value of "y"

# Now that we have a function that can identify the max number out of two values we can implement it in another function and use the same analogy
# We create a new function that takes 3 values, and we call the function (max_of_2) to compare inside this new function

def max_of_3(x, y, z): # We create a function that takes 3 values
    return max_of_2(x, max_of_2(y, z)) # The function returns the value of the output of the (max_of_2) function, which at the same time takes 
    #the first value "x" and the max number out of (y, z) that are calculated in the max_of_2 function    
    
print(max_of_3(1, 3, 8))
